# FovLock
This mod provides one very simple function; the ability to lock the field of view.
In Minecraft, the field of view can change dynamically based on various conditions,
such as sprinting, being submersed in fluid, or flying in creative mode. FovLock
prevents such things from occurring when enabled, locking the field of view at the
specified value in the video options. To toggle the lock, a button is provided next
to the FOV slider on the video options screen, as seen below.
